### Login validation and authentication

The login system ensures that only administrators have access to the application. This authentication process safeguards sensitive school management data.

![image3](https://github.com/LeandervanAarde/UniVerse/blob/Develops/README_Assets/login.jpg)
### Dashboard View

The dashboard provides snapshots of essential school data. It presents statistics such as the total number of students, staff members, subjects, and the aggregated student fees. Additionally, the dashboard offers a glimpse of upcoming school events, ensuring that administrators are always informed.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

##### We started off by implementing the frontend of the application. 

* Simon was responsible for implementing the Login page, as well as the Dashboard. 
* Leander was responsible for implementing the staff and staff overview screen, as well as the Students and student overview screen. He also implemented the flyout navigation.
* Bronwyn created the application designs and she compiled the README. She was responsible for for implementing the subjects and subject overview screen, as well as the funds screen.

##### Following that, we moved onto networking and integration

* Simon handled the validation on the Login screen, adding students and staff, and the imlemetation of the modal for the user to change their password apon their first login. He was also responsible for fot the networking and integration of the funds screen.
* Leander was responsible for researching image uploads, handling the requests for the dashboard on the frontend, implementing charts, handling the login functionality as well as implementing all the functionality in the backend.
* Bronwyn handled the navigation to the overview pages, input capturing, get requests on the frontend for staff, students ans subjects and adding a subject. She also handled removing an enrollment from a subject.

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* Leander enjoyed handling the backend
* Learning C#
* Our group dynamic worked really well.
* Working in a group dynamic and learning more about version control in a group setting

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* Image uploads to prostgreSQL
* Adding subjects, staff and students
* Updating information
* Scrollview on the Subject page
* Cross-platform UI
* Learning of a new programming language (C#)

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* Refinement of the application's UI
* Refinement of the application's adding and editing functionality
* Uploading images to the postgres database
* Color picker
